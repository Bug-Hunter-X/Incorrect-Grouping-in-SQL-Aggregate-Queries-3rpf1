This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries involving aggregate functions and the `GROUP BY` clause. The example shows how including unnecessary columns in the `GROUP BY` clause can lead to inaccurate results when calculating averages or other aggregate values.  The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.
