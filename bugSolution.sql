The solution is to only include the columns you're grouping by in the `GROUP BY` clause.  In this case, we only need to group by `customer_id` to find the average order value for each customer. The corrected SQL query is:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, AVG(order_total) AS average_order_value
FROM orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
This query correctly calculates the average order value for each customer by grouping solely on the `customer_id` column.
